This is a simple N-body simulation with visualisation for exploring the use of Metal for compute and graphics on OS X.

### Usage

With Xcode 7, this project should cleanly build and run without any modifications.

The `d` key can be used to cycle through Metal devices.

The number of bodies can be increased and decreased with the `+` and `-` keys.
